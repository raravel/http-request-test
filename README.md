**Language**
[한국어](./README.ko.md)|[English](./README.md)


Challenge to create module capable of http communication in node.js without `http` module.

### How to challenge?

- Never use http, https or npm modules.
- Create your own folder by copying the `http-request.js` file.
- When you enter a command and finally `PASS` is displayed, it is a success.
- The test must be in the running state of the server.
- You can input code anywere but you can't remove any default code.

Server run command:
```sh
node server.js
```

Test run command:
```sh
node test.js ./[your name]/http-request.js
```


If you see `PASS`, create a pull request.


Good Luck.
